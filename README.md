# Seattle house sales analysis 

The goal of the analysis was to increase the effectiveness of selecting houses for renovation and resale, in addition to that I had to investigate and show sales patterns over the year and week 

Files:
* Quering.dox -> all SQL code used for this project 
* house_sales.csv -> initial dataset 
* Presentation.ptxt -> presentation of findings and results
